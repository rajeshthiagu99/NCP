  In a brief span of 6 years, Amritapuri Campus, one of the 5 campuses under Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is one of the leading higher Educational institutions in the State of Kerala. Amritapuri Campus hosts four Schools: Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita School of Arts & Science, Amrita School of Biotechnology and Amrita School of Ayurveda. The campus is located adjacent to the international headquarters of Mata Amritanandamayi Math and is separated from it by the backwaters linking Kollam and Alappuzha.

  The Ayurveda College and hospital in Amritapuri Campus was established in 2004. The hospital and college is situated on 25 acres land near the backwaters along the coast of Kerala, 3 kms towards west from national highway near Karunagappally. Ayurvedic hospital is fully functional 250 bed, staffed with highly qualified and experienced medical practitioners.It is yet another beautiful expression of the boundless compassion of sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, reflecting her divine resolve to provide high quality holistic health care for all humanity. The school is an important part of Amma's noble aspiration to revitalize the Indian medical heritage, and a wonderful opportunity for all students who wish to obtain the finest possible training in the practice of Ayurvedic medicine.

  In 2004, when Tsunami hit the ashram and surrounding areas of Alappad panchayat, the ashram was temporarily shifted to the campus. College campus was used by Amma to accommodate most of the evacuees from the village. Amma teaches us that any other response in times of unprecedented social distress would have been inadequate. It is this spirit of serving the world that is at the core of Amrita's institutional values and we expect our students to imbibe this spirit of service and cultivate noble human values before during their stay and studies at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
